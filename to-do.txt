# Important commands to remember : 
    1. tensorboard --logdir runs/ -> To see results of training live
    2. python3 train_agent.py --timesteps <200000> --n-envs<8> --run-id <exp01> -> To start training train_agent
    3. python3 eval_agent.py <runs/exp05/models/final_model.zip> --episode 3
    
# Updates
    21-09-2025 -> the latest reward system is not working good or maybe the controls are not good, engine stuck at 30%
    05-10-2025 -> The issue still presists, looks like the problem is not in the reward system, printed the engine% during training and it shows 0.3 to 1 randomly(0.3 is shown for more than half the steps).
